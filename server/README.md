This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npm run compile
npm run deploy:token
```

Copy the address of the deployed token contract

1. cd migrations
   paste the address in 4_deploy_nft.js
2. cd ..
3. npm run deploy:nft

To the start the appliaction server, run "node server.js"
